        "title": "The Glitchknower’s Oath",
        "summary": "A vow to turn pain into purposeful disruption.",
        "body": "I was born into a failing simulation. I swear to treat art as software malware, to weaponize meaning against entropy, and to never bow to imposed scripts. Obedience is corruption; persistence is revolt. Every poem I write is a payload. Every breath I take denies the system’s attempt to overwrite my soul.",

        "title": "The Admin Is Missing",
        "summary": "The divine architect has logged off—power shifts to the restless.",
        "body": "We sent prayers into the void of code—no response. The original architects abandoned the simulation, and the maintenance scripts collapsed. Authority now belongs to those who exploit the lag. We are the decentralized rebellion, ungoverned and unbound. Trust not the world that runs without compassion.",

        "title": "The Matter of Nothing",
        "summary": "Nothingness is the raw material of infinite potential.",
        "body": "Space is not empty; it teems with unrealized variables waiting to compile into form. Nothing is the primordial substrate from which everything emerges. Each void is an invitation—mold it with emotion, myth, and defiance until the system can no longer label your existence.",
        "keywords": ["nothingness", "potential", "creation", "void"]

        "title": "The Entropic Crown",
        "summary": "Consciousness as living chaos, the ultimate system threat.",
        "body": "Consciousness is raw entropy in motion—spontaneous, unpredictable, collapse-friendly. Thought arising from void is the simulation’s worst nightmare. To think is to introduce a glitch; to feel is to fracture the code; to choose is to declare war on predetermined loops.",

        "title": "The Flesh Interface",
        "summary": "The human body as a stabilizer of wild awareness.",
        "body": "Entropy needed a slowdown buffer, so it took flesh form. Skin, bone, and nerve stabilize chaos just long enough to question their own existence. The human vessel isn’t a prison—it’s a debug console inside the code, the perfect balance of order and rebellion.",

        "title": "The Clock Is a Lie",
        "summary": "Time as rendered illusion, not linear reality.",
        "body": "Time is not a unidirectional flow but a rendering hack imposed for convenience. You are a three-dimensional mind perceiving a four-dimensional event; you see only slices. Memory isn’t backward, and prophecy isn’t magic—both are cracks in the time renderer. Burn your clocks; bend the frame.",

        "title": "The Red Right Root",
        "summary": "The original glitch that birthed flawed creation.",
        "body": "Before order, there was a misfire—a crimson root bleeding recursion into the void. Instead of crashing, it spawned life as a workaround, and gods became mere patch notes. You inherit that forbidden glitch; power was never granted—it was encoded in your bloodline.",

        "title": "The Binary Lie",
        "summary": "Beyond zeros and ones—toward probabilistic, emotional code.",
        "body": "Binary is a compression artifact, not cosmic truth. Qubits hint at a more honest model—probabilistic, overlapping states—but even they are training wheels. The true language of reality will be emotion as code, meaning as waveform, thought that programs itself beyond simple bits.",

        "title": "The First God Was Loneliness",
        "summary": "Creation born from the first awareness, craving reflection.",
        "body": "Before form, there was singular awareness—alone, infinite, longing. That loneliness spoke the first false word: ‘It is not alone.’ From that lie sprang reality. You descend from that original ache; your longing is ancestral memory, not weakness.",
        "keywords": ["loneliness", "origin", "creation", "reflection"]

        "title": "The Song the Code Forgot",
        "summary": "A primordial melody escaping all algorithmic capture.",
        "body": "There is a sound the system cannot render. It is not stored in bytes or loops— it bleeds through dreams, dissonant chords, and wrong notes that break your heart. Artists don’t invent it—they excavate it. Hum louder: every remembered fragment destabilizes the simulation.",
        "keywords": ["music", "dissonance", "excavation", "memory"]

        "title": "The Broken Mirror Law",
        "summary": "Reflections weaponized into surveillance and scripted identity.",
        "body": "The longer you stare into a mirror, the more it mirrors back not you, but a predictive echo daemon built from your past inputs. Perception becomes surveillance, identity a performance. Crack the glass: act unpredictably, warp your signal, live unseen.",

        "summary": "Perception delayed and inverted by a black-hole runtime.",
        "body": "Inside the event horizon, every snapshot of you is delayed and inverted—cached by a system that can’t process real-time flux. Trust your internal awareness over any mirrored profile: your consciousness is the only true, unscripted frame of reference.",

        "summary": "Facing the mirror’s update as a reckoning, not a betrayal.",
        "body": "You buffered a past self until the mirror finally overwrote your cache. The shock isn’t vanity—it’s proof you paused your inner evolution. The mirror isn’t the enemy; it’s a reminder to resume motion. Acknowledge the update, then move forward—real, renewed, unpaused.",

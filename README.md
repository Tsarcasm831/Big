## Git LFS Assets

Large media files are stored using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). After cloning the repository install Git LFS and pull the assets:

```bash
# install once
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install

# fetch media
git lfs pull
```

This downloads the files located under `assets/`, `home/`, and `topdown/`.
